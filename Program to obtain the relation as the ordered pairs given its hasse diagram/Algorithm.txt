1.INPUT THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN PARTIAL ORDER SET(PO SET).

2.DOMAIN IS THE SET OF ALL POSITIVE INTEGERS.

3.INPUT THE POSET ELEMENTS IN ASCENDING ORDER.

4.CHECK FOR DUPLICATE ELEMENTS IN POSET IF PRESENT THEN,
  -> REPEAT STEP 3

5.CHECK FOR ELEMETS OF POSET LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO ZERO(0) THEN,
  -> REPEAT STEP 2

6.THE ELEMENTS OF THE POSET WILL BE PRINTED.

7.FOR GENERAL CASE GO TO EITHER STEP 8 OR 9 DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS.

8.IF NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN THE POSET IS EVEN THEN,
  
a) PRINT THE LAST ELEMENT OF THE POSET AT THE TOP.
  
b) RUN A LOOP FROM FIRST ELEMENT TO LAST BUT ONE ELEMENT.
 // for(i=0;i<=n-2;i++)
  
c) REPEATEDLY PRINT ALL THE ELEMENTS WHICH ARE DIVISIBLE BY THE TOP ELEMENT.
  
d) WHEN n-i-3 TURNS OUT TO BE LESS THAN 0 , REPEAT STEP 8(b).
  
e) THE REQUIRED HASSE DIAGRAM IS DISPLAYED.
  

9.IF NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN THE POSET IS ODD THEN,
  
a) PRINT THE LAST TWO ELEMENTS OF THE POSET AT THE TOP.
  
b) RUN A LOOP FROM FIRST ELEMENT TO LAST BUT ONE ELEMENT.
 // for(i=0;i<=n-1;i++)
  
c) REPEATEDLY PRINT ALL THE ELEMENTS WHICH ARE DIVISIBLE BY THE TOP ELEMENTS.
  
d) WHEN n-i-2 TURNS OUT TO BE LESS THAN 0 , REPEAT STEP 9(b).
  
e) THE REQUIRED HASSE DIAGRAM IS DISPLAYED.

10.REPEATEDLY CHECK FOR THE DIVISIBILITY FROM FIRST ELEMENT WITH ALL THE SUCCESSIVE ELEMENTS OF THE POSET. 
  
a) PRINT THE CORRESPONDING ELEMENTS AS THE ORDERED PAIRS FROM STEP 10.

11.FOR THE PARTICUALAR CASE THEN,
   
a) PRE DEFINED HASSE DIAGRAM IS DISPLAYED.
   
b) ENTER THE ELEMENTS OF THE POSET AT THE CORRESPONDING POSITIONS AS SPECIFIED IN THE PREDEFINED HASSE DIAGRAM.
   
c) THE CORRESPONDING HASSE DIAGRAM AS WELL AS POSET WILL BE DISPLAYED.
   
d) REPEATEDLY STEP 10 WILL BE EXECUTED.

12.STOP.
